## 100-Day SystemVerilog Challenge

Welcome to the 100-Day SystemVerilog Challenge, a beginner-to-advanced roadmap designed to help you learn SystemVerilog for RTL Design, Testbench Development, Verification, and UVM step by step.
This challenge is structured with daily tasks, mini-projects, and progress goals to help you stay consistent and build a strong understanding of modern verification practices.

### Objective

The main objective of this challenge is to:

Build a strong foundation in SystemVerilog RTL and Testbench development

Gradually move towards OOP, CRV, Coverage, Assertions, and UVM

Develop hands-on skills through daily coding tasks and projects

Create a complete verified GitHub portfolio

Practice learning in public with daily LinkedIn posts

Become job-ready for Verification / DFT / VLSI roles

### Challenge Structure

The 100 days are divided into 4 phases, each increasing in complexity:

### Phase 1: SystemVerilog Basics (Day 1–20)

Focus: RTL Design, Syntax, Data Types, Modules

Topics Covered

What is SystemVerilog?

Data types, operators, arrays

always_ff, always_comb

Modules, ports, parameters

Loops, functions, tasks

Interfaces

Mini RTL projects (Counter, ALU, FIFO, UART TX)

### Phase 2: Testbench & OOP (Day 21–50)

Focus: Basic Verification + OOP for TB Development

Topics Covered

Testbench structure (driver, monitor, scoreboard)

Mailbox, events

Clock & reset logic

Classes & objects

Inheritance, polymorphism

Randomization (rand/randc)

Constraint solving

Functional coverage

### Phase 3: Assertions & UVM (Day 51–85)

Focus: SVA + Professional Verification Flow (UVM)

Topics Covered

Properties, sequences, implication

Protocol assertions (AXI-lite, FIFO, handshake)

UVM basics: components, agent, env

Driver/Monitor communication

Sequencer & sequences

Config DB, factory, phases

RAL & advanced UVM features

### Phase 4: Final Projects (Day 86–100)

Focus: Full Verification Projects

Projects

UART UVM Verification

AXI-Lite Mini Verification IP

APB Slave Verification

ALU Coverage + CRV + SVA

Final portfolio + documentation
